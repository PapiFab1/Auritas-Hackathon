# Auritas-Hackathon

A Python-based tool for analyzing and decoding SAP .ARCHIVE files generated through the SAP Archive Development Kit (ADK).
This project was created as part of the Auritas Hackathon 2025 â€“ Algorithm Decryption Challenge.
It identifies binary segments, extracts readable information, and interprets record structures,
then exports the results into JSON for integration with a Flask-based visualization dashboard.

## Quickstart
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
or install these:
flask
pandas
lz4
zstandard
chardet
tqdm
```
## Run the decoder file
Run decoder.py and view the results in algorithms/results/
